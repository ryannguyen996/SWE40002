1153,1,"I feel like I havent learnt anything, as the work was always copying what was in the lecture with our own additional changes. The tasks make sense but we dont go into detail about how to produce them",5
127,1,"*File organisation on blackboard. Same information repeated in multiple docs in confusing ways. Blackboard not used properly.
*Lectures need more clarity and explanation.
*The entire subject is geared towards architecture students and students 'going to work in an architectural office'... but we are all interior designers and I am going to work in an interior design studio. Needs more re-alignment to this.",5

5308,1,"The learning methods. I've heard a lot of people saying that this was a 'dry' subject. Some of the learnings weren't practical, and didn't interest the students enough. Students should have their own brief to choose for the project management unit, so everyone would be doing different thing. Most people just copy-and-paste because the answers were all the same, anyway. If students could choose their own brief, I think it'd be more interesting to see/ do.",5
