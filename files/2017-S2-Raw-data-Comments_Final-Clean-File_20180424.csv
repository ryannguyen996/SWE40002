5,5,Well structured,5
6,6,"Lecture content, particulary week <> gave about crime and violence/guns as was a hard week in the media and she gave great explanation of gun violence",5
7,1,it was well organised and allowed you to think about what it would be like if you ran your own company,5
8,7,having a video record for this unit is necessary,5
9,8,The concepts of the unit,5
10,9,I appreciate that having the weekly questions to submit really helps with preparation prior to the in class discussion and I feel as though you get more from the subject when you research before the class and can contribute your ideas confidently.,5
11,10,"A very honest, realistic and relevant summary of the main areas and major critiques of <>. <> is massively engaging and <> is super organised and so level-headed - what a great team",5

13,10,"<> understanding and presentation of the material in a sophisticated, but understandle way.",5
14,12,The wiki page was great as you could see the work of other students and compare it with what we had done.,5
15,13,"<>, shes a great tutor",5
16,14,The practical use of <> and <> help usually with explanation which were thorough,5
17,15,<> was by far one of the best teachers I've had at Swinburne. <> was always enthusiastic and looking to engage the students in discussion.  One thing I enjoyed most about this unit was the freedom we had to explore the various topics.,5
18,16,The movies chosen had a great range and depending on the genre of the week it was easy to learn,5
19,17,lectures are sort of good. Definitely better than the previous convener,5
20,10,The content was fascinating.,5
21,18,"Overall pretty good unit, pretty good lectures ect",5

23,20,"The project in  which we made our own comic and wrote a reflective essay, and the workshop class with <> was fantastic (so were all other interactions with people from the industry)",5
24,21,all good,5
25,22,students can have too much time to discuss with the teacher.,5
26,23,Useful knowledge for technology in real life,5
27,24,doing the labs and practical work in the labs,5
28,25,"The numerous techniques covered by the tutorials, focusing on all the basics of photography such as lighting, movement, scale and colour.",5
29,26,"I really enjoyed this unit overall. I enjoyed the creative freedom and found that it was a good environment to discuss ideas without judgement or negativity. 
I felt supported as a learner and also a writer.",5
30,27,"<> is incredibly good at what <> does, very happy with <> tutelage.",5
30,28,"Lectures are incredibly well put together. Content heavy but every page is necessary, cannot appreciate that enough. All teachers also seemed excited about what they were doing, which helped a lot.",5
31,29,Interesting topics,5
32,30,"Teacher is nice and does give some good one on one advice. However, lectures are useless and not helpful, as well as everything else in this unit. And - NO TECHNICAL HELP.",5
33,11,Lecturer,5
34,31,"The videos, open discussions, group activities and <> encouragement and support.",5
35,32,The practical examples used in class,5
36,32,"I really enjoyed the practical side of the labs of learning how to do some statistics and I found it to be enjoyable and helpful. In class, <> tried to make it as enjoyable as he can for us also which I appreciate.",5
37,33,"Work-shopping in class is always a great way to get feedback from both the tutor and peers. Lectures are always packed with content, demonstrating all the possible things you can focus on in the text analysis.",5
38,34,the scenarios and <> charm and raw charisma,5
39,35,"<> is a very knowledgeable and helpful tutor, who ensures that each student understands the content of this unit extremely well.",5
40,36,Personally I would like to see this unit completely restructured.,5
41,37,The content and topics.,5
42,38,"Good enough, help us to develop real project with industry view and skill.",5
43,8,"This is probably my favourite class this semester. I really like the structure, dividing the course into the two sections, I think it works really effectively. I also just loved the content and the use of examples throughout the lectures.",5
44,39,The freedom of working digitally was a benefit as it helped us complete work at our own pace whilst still meeting deadlines.,5
45,22,I enjoyed the interactive approach the facilitator used to make the class more lively and encourage people to share their views and understanding of the concepts. It was an enriching atmosphere despite the 3 hours sessions - it was never boring or tiring as time was used well in teaching and discussion.,5
46,40,"<> teaching is great, and the experience of shooting 16mm is absolutely unbeatable. This class was amazing and the opportunity to use film was so so so valuable. Loved this class",5
47,8,"The lectures, and learning about adaptation processes and how the film industry is changing to revolve around trans media franchises. The tutorial discussions were also informative and lots of fun.",5

49,42,"The first group assignment was good, although my group found it hard to keep up stamina for the second.",5

51,26,The use of video interviews was fantastic. It gave us the opportunity to listen to how they talk and the natural way they tell their stories.,5
52,43,"Interesting, lots of hand on work.",5
53,44,The  weekly feedback and the assessment feedback,5
54,45,The online tests,5
55,27,I found the structure of the course work really helpful and refreshing. Having the important tutorial tasks get submitted and marked with the assignment tasks is far better than a portfolio set-up as it forces students to be up-to-date and motivates them to work well as their work gets marked. This structure worked very well for my learning style and im assuming most students did very well in this unit as most programming units haven't actually thought about the best structure for the students they choose the most logical way but also a way that makes their marking job the easiest.,5
56,46,labs.,5
56,47,Labs and <> was good in teaching.,5
57,48,"Tutorial times were used effectively, where the class was encouraged to lead discussion and friendly debate. <> steps back enough to allow the class to conduct it's own discussion but also has complete control of the space as well, and contributes her own honest opinions which is very helpful.",5
58,49,We can practice and do a practical project.,5
59,50,Lecturer <> is very experienced and kind. Tutor <> is very very responsible and encouraging with students!,5
60,12,<> lectures where very engaging and interesting,5
61,25,"The final project of design the photo book was by far the most enjoyable part of the unit, and the only real time I learnt how photography works with design.",5
62,51,Communication between teacher/student and relevant information,5
63,52,The best aspects were the relatively open scope when completing assessments.,5
64,53,"Appreciate the effort of constructing the lecture slides. They were really nice and mostly understandable. Content was great. Full on though!
Practicals were very interesting, I liked the TBI experiment and evoked potentials as it was hands on.
Many people had problems with the due dates, very appreciated that many extensions were given. To avoid as many extensions for students taking the unit in the future: simpler is often better, assessment guides could seem overwhelming to some students. Regular check-in with students at the start of lectures to avoid frustration. Better communication among teaching staff, as well as being more present on blackboard.",5
65,54,Lectures and labs were well organised and each topic was explained deeply in each type of class mode with examples from few similar tasks. It was very organised and we were able to keep track of how we are going in tasks with reminders from lecturer in blackboard. Help desk was extremely beneficial and the tutors there were really helpful and guided me with calmness. Weekly videos were also a major help when struggling with challenging tasks so that was really helpful.,5
66,40,Still getting to use 16mm in this day and age.,5
67,55,"The straightforward content, the tutors.",5
68,56,4 hours of lectures is a good amount of time to be able to learn everything. Tutorial questions are relevant.,5
69,57,"Fascinating subject matter, I love <>  lectures. he is so interesting to listen to and delivers the information in such a logical and easy to understand matter. His lectures are probably the best laid out and delivered of all of my units which is amazing because I feel like I get a really good grasp of the subject and am able to take really good notes as well.",5
70,25,"The colour assignment and I liked the use of Flickr, as I gained feedback on my photos through comments.",5
71,58,"The content presented in an understandable manner, the group work sheets to collaborate on ideas and engage with peers",5
71,59,The reiteration of key concepts in tutorials with practical examples,5
72,17,The clicker questions and the tutorials were the best approach towards learning.  The few physcasts that were there helped to assimilate the information very well.  The labs were well-designed and very integrated with the content - I should have chose the 'odd number' weeks because doing the labs on the even weeks meant that I missed out on the relevant information on the week it was presented.,5
73,60,the project of creating a board game prototype,5
74,61,<> clearly sets out the process of answering problem questions.,5
75,62,Learning provides sufficient resources for students to help them improve with their studies.,5
76,63,"*Practising in the lecture 
*The online test, it was letting me to study topic per topic 
*The unit in general is interesting and I really enjoyed it",5
77,43,tutorial activities,5
78,64,"there was nothing related to design field, we were just talking about aboriginals.",5
79,65,"I strongly disappointing on how this unit programmed/organized.  As a international student i traveled all the way to here to learn some new skills and develop knowledge. however, this unit is conducted on online based classes.",5
80,66,clear structured examples,5
81,67,All of the content we have learned in class is extremely valuable. I have already used the skills I have learned this semester in production management on short film shoots and my organisation and communication during production has already improved. The lessons are well-structured so that we have class time to work on our group assignments which takes pressure off of trying to organise a group together outside of class.,5
82,68,Lectures often compressed the examined content into the first hour so we could all leave early.,5
78,65,I did not liked it at all. As I learned nothing out of this unit. Plus the outline is so confusing and no teaching session made it more difficult.,5
83,69,The visual aids and the computer programs like MDsolids really helps with cementing understanding.,5
84,70,The option to explore new forms of media in Assignment 2.,5
85,15,it is well explained and i like the teaching.,5
86,71,teaching method is superb,5
87,63,"I really enjoyed the teachers both <> and <>. 

<> was great to get to know, and <> was very thorough in her teaching.",5
88,42,The way <> presented the topic and is never ending urge to help me,5
89,72,the teacher can fix our report problem and give useful suggestions,5
90,73,<> tuts.,5
91,74,The way my teacher revised the topics and explained it to me.,5
92,75,Group assessment to meet new people,5
93,76,Teacher's understanding and support throughout the project,5
94,77,"I enjoyed doing more assessments, compared to less in my other ones. It is more work, but it is more fair and I think that was a great idea.",5
92,78,Tutes,5
95,75,"Uh..nothing? Drawing is okay, but we're not artists..

<> was the only helpful tutor - give this girl a medal!",5

98,81,Topics covered,5

100,83,<> continuous support in the project. <> support material like videos and books that help us in the diagramming and creation process.,5
101,78,Cooperation with the teachers and feedback on ways to improve.,5
102,84,"lectures very engaging, <> has excellent way of describing things",5
103,85,"how we can improve our ways into conserve energy, and come up with other products.",5
104,41,"<> enthusiasm and genuine interest in seeing us learn the prototyping process was a refreshing change. A lot of the lecturers and conveners we get in this University just do not care. <> gave his all in this unit, and the content was better because of it. 10/10 unit, would take it again.",5
105,86,Getting hands on experience working on a project with the help of the teachers is a great setting to learn this.,5
106,87,"In my personal opinion, the excel spreadsheets was the best facet of this particular <>. Having the capability to use spreadsheets for financial analysis adds value to my professional/personal development, respectfully. 

Moreover, the <> assignment was certainly challenging - took up a hefty amount of time. However, I did gain valuable insight in regards to the capital market – IPOs and trading shares.",5
107,88,Including many areas,5
108,89,"<> is so passionate about <>and it's contagious. Not to mention he's a top lecturer, which unfortunately lead to my other ones this semester seeming quite pale by comparison. Or the other tutors, since I was lucky enough to be in his labs. He keeps things fun, relevant and oh so interesting.

Also the labs are really well written. )b",5
109,90,Information and delivery of the lectures and flexibility within the tutes to explore different concepts and opinions arising from lecture and reading content.,5
108,91,It's nice to get my 'hands dirty' again and have a unit with lots of coding involved.,5
110,92,The Laboratories. I found that a majority of my understanding of the content was from taking what I'd learnt in lectures and solidifying it with writing a Laboratory report.,5
111,93,Excellent lecturer.,5
112,94,The video's were good and the support resources,5
113,95,the amounf of pracstise prensetions and feedback for big report.,5
114,18,The information on the topic of <> is very interesting.,5

116,96,"Exposure to a wide range of areas in psychology. I was not aware of most of the topic areas included in the weekly presentations, and being exposed to all the areas made me appreciate the possibilities for psychologists, either in post-graduate studies or in the field.",5
117,97,"I found that I knew a lot of the content from other <> units. <> felt like a refresher of everything I had studied previously, which made it easy and enjoyable as a final semester unit.",5
118,98,<>  enthusiastic and energetic teaching! He has pushed the class to think like marketers and not students doing a marketing assignment. I have learnt a lot from this class and <> teaching.,5
119,99,... exploring the Cold War in a completely different perspective than covered in<>. Given the pace and complexity of the Cold War each country could fill a units worth of content; I really enjoyed the balance struck between studying European and wider Asiatic Cold War confrontations / developments.,5
120,74,the constant examples made it easier to learn,5
117,100,"<> is a great tutor who reakky cares about her students, I think she was the best aspect of the unit.",5
121,101,"Having actual moderation and assessing practice, rather than just theoretical delivery",5
122,70,"As much as this unit can be so stressful due to being thrown into unfamiliar territory, I do enjoy the uniqueness of the projects. I've never worked on installations before, and this project terrified me of failing it. But it has helped me to really stretch my creativeness into the films.",5
123,102,The group assignment enables us to be creative and further improve our teamwork skills.,5
123,7,"Tute labs; everything is taught and practiced in the same class.
Support for class topics and assignments are well done.",5
124,103,"This unit is one of the best units for any student to do!
It teaches us many key aspects to any project and that is how to deal with the client and dealing with issues you encounter.
It also makes you feel really good when you get the finished product at the end, and see where all your hard work has gone to!",5

Individual appointments.
Flexibility in deliverables and brief writing.
Lack of lectures towards the end (would be unnecessary)",5
128,94,"Despite my suggestion of improvement, I overall enjoyed the unit.",5
129,35,<>  help was probably the best part. Although the content seemed quite rushed through the semester. He helped in any way he could.,5

134,109,"Really interesting being able to code graphics and create effectively something, in this case a robot, out of nothing.",5
135,110,"Guest lectures and usage of modern tools (Continuous deployment using Azure would get you bonus points though). Most subjects use old tech, so I was impressed to see a relatively recent service.",5
133,3,It was nice how much freedom they gave us just to work on our projects and how they treated us as equals.,5

140,119,"The online tutorials are really helpful- allowing you to complete the weekly tasks at your own pace, and go back, review and fully grasp concepts.",5
135,3,The staff. They made what they could out of a bad situation. The freedom to develop what I wanted was also great.  The unit is brilliant when it's given the resources it needs.,5

142,121,Help and advice in the labs was good and the lectures were done really well. going through the examples in the lectures helped maintain an understanding of how everything works instead of leaving you to catch up if something didnt make sense.,5

150,129,I absolutely loved coming to class each an every week. It was always engaging and presented in a way that allowed for an extensive understanding of the content.

151,130,basic maths revision,5
152,131,The occasional one-on-one feedback was quite helpful.,5
153,132,The assignments were enjoyable and challenging. I enjoyed being able to work on them at my own pace (when possible!),5

155,133,Each topic was interesting and and made you think,5

157,31,The teachers,5

158,136,The assignments and the tutorials.,5
159,137,"Overall, it is a hard subject to teach as there is a lot of content. <> tries very hard to have an interesting subject and we can see that. <> was always very nice and was great in listening to students. For the lectures there is just too much content to remember, maybe in future lectures have certain weeks dedicated to the assignment and others for learning other topics.",5

She made great finishing today with amazing strategy game.",5

178,157,online accessibility for course material and lectures,5
179,158,"I'm not sure who organised the guest lecturers but the quality of people coming were absolutely fantastic. Despite the fact that most were Fairfax journalists, the variety of people coming in were great and week to week, i learned a lot out of what they had to say. The work to get them in didn't go unnoticed i guarantee you.  I thought Assignment 1 was perfect. Worth 25%. A valuable exercise for all students and fun to read for anyone who wanted it on the standard.",5
176,159,"- The ambiguous concept of designing a project that is a project for someone else is pretty clever. Once we all figured that out, we were pretty excited about that. It was something none of us had done before.

194,168,"The concept behind the unit, the idea of picking one animal and sticking with it through the whole unit was quite moving.

386,25,"I thoroughly enjoyed this unit, my favourite task was probably either the Light task or the colour task, I have enjoyed making my photobook as well.",5
387,257,"The goals part was helpful- the readings actually helped me understand how to determine my goals, why these goals are important to me and consider how I might achieve these. It was also great to define our idea of success. It was interesting to read others responses. I think we had a decent class and most people seemed comfortable actually having discussions. I also liked the powerpoint presentations that you download and listen to- there were a couple which I found very valuable. Some content included information I was already familiar with however, it was good to have it outlined clearly and with sophistication.",5

I was becoming a little disillusioned with Swinburne Screen Studies, where it was focusing its energy and how it was engaging and providing relevance to students interested in Cinema (so much seemed to be focused blockbusters, TV, animation and video games).

437,303,"1st = <> detailed explanation and reinforcing style (explains concept, then asks us questions and tells us to write it down if we don't know the answer - even as adult learners it is good to have strong guidance sometime) are presented in a logical, orderly manner that facilitates deep understanding of each concept and just how the jigsaw puzzle of human physiology all works together. 

2nd = Weekly tests keep us from falling behind (which is vital with such an large learning content) and show us just where we need to refocus our study. The 2 attempts for each test, with the second attempt offering slightly different questions really pushes us to know our content. If the lab test was somehow combined with the content test, and pushed out to be a fortnightly test this may have reduced some pressure to keep up to date, but my experience in other units of constantly having to double check if something is on this week or not and the ever present anxiety that I may muck up my weeks and miss a test, is completely removed in this unit by having a weekly test of one sort or another. I found it so much easier to just know ""right, let's get this week's test done"", even with a rather traumatic semester (as I had this semester) I preferred to have a weekly commitment. My units that didn't have such a weekly demand, I found I either accidentally mucked up and missed a test (or 2!! and I have well organised spreadsheets designed to prevent that, but that failed me in times of great stress!), or for those without any tests, I didn't committed enough time consistently throughout the semester to keep up to date, and now at week 12, I have a mountain ahead of me.

563,366,"<> is definitely the best part of this Unit. Having <> makes this unit good, in a way <> is good at showing you what to do instead of explaining what to do to you. I guess it's the way Maya is, showing someone how to do things in Maya is easier than explaining it in front of student.",5

584,373,"My 'teacher' is <> and I have rated him below, accordingly.  Overall I think he is a really good guy and all, he is really enthusiastic and great at communicating design ideas.  Problem is, he doesn't teach to the class as a whole, I can only recall one (or two) classes when he actually did a tutorial.  He does many 1 on 1 during the class and that's good but it's not so good for people that he does not get a chance to see.  Another problem is that he doesn't do much teaching in the class or theory on how markers work.  I feel like my sketching has not really improved that much at all this semester.  His feedback on the projects are also very vague.  With so many students in the class, he should do some collective work rather than 1 on 1.

I liked the first assignment and the pitch and final assignment because they made me think critically about how I could present business concepts and how I could present myself to businesses as a potential employee.",5
1164,257,Having many different lecturers from different fields in the industry to provide lectures on the topics made understanding certain parts of <> very easy to understand. Looking at other students' contributions and different perspectives on topics gave me a broader understanding on the respective topic.,5

1165,86,Pracs were great learning experiences.,5
1166,276,The teachers from this unit have been the most helpful throughout my course at uni. I appreciate their ongoing support throughout the unit.  The feedback given individually has really helped me and I've learnt and believe I have improved greatly because of it.,5

1168,433,"The open book exam, the content was interesting and applicable. Very accessible for someone like myself who has not studied any law before.",5
136,270,"the test were a good way of doing Revision.
The fact that the test questions were from the tutorial question could mean that the exam might also be from the tutorial questions

My experience of the subject was that I really liked it and would go over the tutes each week making sure I understood them, sometimes do unit outline questions that weren't done in the tutes and watch the lectures again and make notes from them. I was building a good foundation for the subject. But all this stopped when the tests came along, as all of a sudden the focus had to be on getting a good mark each week. I realise that secondary assessments are a part of the way things are done (for other subjects as well) but I really resent the time they take away from actual learning.",5
1171,274,The lectures were clear and concise. The additional help offered by <> and the other teachers was very generous and helpful.,5

Without a doubt <> is one of the best lecturers at Swinburne.  He's engaging, learned, funny, passionate and he controls the classroom very well.  

<> is equally an engaging lecturer and teacher (although I only had her a few times).  

The material was intersting, but it would not have been nearly as interesting without these amazing accepting people helming it.",5
1175,166,"great amount of things learnt, good leaning gradient. is a bit difficult to catch up if you miss a few labs or tutes though.",5
143,119,great videos as a resource,5

1186,166,<> is a legend. Very organised and very passionate about the subject material.,5
1187,298,"Unquestionably, <> was the most active and consistent person I have ever seen on Blackboard. Marked forum posts every week demands rigorously on time maintenance of the weekly topics, and it worked.

<> also did a very good job of outlining the assignment requirements better than most job applications I've seen (sorry, needed to make a weird analogy somewhere). Told me what to do from the get-go.",5
1188,19,the tutorials,5
1174,304,<> was a very enthusiastic tutor who taught the tutorials at a high level,5
1189,86,The labs were interesting and not as prescriptive as other units,5
1190,531,"Content was generally interesting, and well taught",5
1176,115,"The lectures also being used similarly to a tutorial class. Most units in my <> degree have too much time allocate to classic lectures and not enough for tutorial classes where the theory is put into practice. Most of the assessment for a unit is testing students ability to put theory into practice, not about the theory itself so for most students, tutorials are more important than the lecture. In each of the lectures, examples were not only explained but worked through which helps a lot to understand how to apply the material.",5
1191,19,Labs and Tutes with <>,5
149,219,"Providing a weekly schedule, full lecture notes etc makes what is expected of students very clear. Lectures and tutorials are effective at providing worked solutions and all the content you need. Tutors & lecturers present well and are responsive to questions.",5
149,199,"Fantastic balance of regular fortnightly assignments, in-class work, and overall assignment. Possibly the only time where in class ice-breaking/learning activities were genuinely enjoyable and useful to the content we're learning.

1 x 3hr class is definitely the best way to run it.",5
1174,7,<> was a very positive tutor who was engaging although the classes were so long,5

1196,296,"If you can construe being yelled at, confused, worried you are about to enter the legal sector not having a god damn clue about admin law as a good thing, then yes, these would be good things about this unit.",5
1192,190,its a really well set out subject. the blackboard is very helpful and the use of two online tests i found very manageable,5
147,224,Scheduling and estimating was not dissimilar to what is completed out in the workforce so this subject presenting students with schedules and whatnot is very good experience. The fact of the matter is that most students will be doing scheduling and estimating as their first job when they graduate.,5
149,126,"<> scaring the class into submission to work effectively.

In retrospect, <> demands are not unreasonable, and work very effectively in demonstrating to myself the level and quality of work that I can output if I put in the time. This carries over to <> section as well.

Kahoot's are also genuinely effective in keeping the lecture engaging.

<>, <> and <> were great at giving feedback, and were clear in what was expected of the class and assignments. There are very few units that are as clear as this one.

1198,70,Flexibility to explore whatever experimental avenue we liked.,5
145,150,"The best aspects is that there are two tests, which covers half of the learning materials, which means only half of the learning materials are covered in the final exam.",5
151,253,The tutor is really passionate and knows what shes talking about,5
150,18,I enjoyed each topic covered in this unit and the assignments provided a good challenge. My tutor <> was very engaging especially on a <> <> and it was always a joy to come to her class. I have had her in the past and she has improved greatly in her teaching.,5
1199,525,The wealth of knowledge of the instructor and the use of real world scenarios to demonstrate the topics.,5
151,425,the tutor and convenor are really cool and deliver well and clear,5
1200,533,I loved the different issues and interesting theories raised within a topic. I also loved how there were discussion questions at the end of the lecture. Hearing the class opinion on things really made me learn more.,5
1201,3,"I loved how this unit and the corresponding Semester 1 unit enabled students to spend a whole year putting all their skills to use in a real project. The project we had was challenging but achievable, and we were basically given free reign to organise by ourselves how it would be achieved over the year. I liked how there wasn't too many useless time-wasting aspects of the unit - for much of it there were no lectures (which are a bit of a waste of time for a subject like this).",5
1202,243,the week by week planning,5
3,117,"The assignments and tutor. I loved how this unit was structured, it was about the content, which I wish most units in Swinburne Computer Science were about. Portfolio's and technical assignments are the way to go in my opinion.",5

152,327,The in-depth feedback on the assignments was really appreciated.,5
1204,23,"Kahoot was fun and designing an app was a good learning experience, except it was all marred by the problems mentioned above.",5
1205,88,The close relationship between the instructor and the groups that were undergoing assignment 2. The material covered as well and the way the lab work was conducted.,5
1206,424,"Overall I was very happy with this unit, I felt it was well delivered and organised. It was challenging (I imagine student who do not have some <> experience would likely struggle with this unit) but I got a lot out of it. I always pose the question to myself, what value did I get out of doing this subject? In this case I think it was good value, I learned a lot and was able to refine pre existing skills. I just hope I get to build on what I have learnt.",5
1207,140,The creative writing aspects and of course reading different genre texts in our own time.,5
1207,441,"Really engaging and compelling course content, the lectures were extremely entertaining and well spoken, and the tutorials were also a great place to engage. Some other units didn't come close to the level of engagement. <> was also surprisingly practical as a subject.",5
3,277,"The discussions and realism invoked by our tutor, <>. The unit was also VERY clear on what items were needed to be produced and keeping us on track with due dates.",5
1208,535,"<>, an amazing teacher always positive and wanting to help.",5
1209,396,"<> attempted to spice up the boring material by adding some fun examples and scenarios. Although I still dislike and struggle with <>, it was nice to have a lecturer who was extremely friendly and approachable and seemed lively and happy to be there.",5
1210,519,organisation,5
158,140,Wonderful and engaging unit. I liked the variety of genres that were explored. I learned a lot about a lot of different texts that I wouldn't really have discussed otherwise.,5
158,66,The lectures.,5
1211,443,"The complexity of the subject could have been completely overwhelming without the dedication of the tutor to help students understand the matter, but also in the context of real-life situations.",5
1212,477,The in class negotiation exercise was great - doing the scenario really helped me contextualise what that aspect of the course is about.,5
1213,511,"I've enjoyed every aspect of this unit. From the topics covered in class to the different types of assessment. I've really felt that this class as been a great set up and base knowledge for going into what could be a very daunting thesis next semester. I'm really appreciative that we were able to write a literature review this semester, it seems like a really practical use of time and energy.",5
161,174,I really like how the assessments are different to the typical lab report that is commonly used as the major assessment for most <> units.,5
1214,159,group work,5
1215,536,The readings from week 3 onwards were beneficial.,5
1216,10,I did love the lectures the lecture was very approachable and welcoming. I really liked the discussion focused approach that was used in the lectures.,5
1213,536,"I really enjoyed the assignments for this class. Writing two short essays was fun, especially when we got to pick the three articles from our field as it was a good exercise in getting us to start writing about our topic of interest.",5

1217,18,Everything,5
159,537,"The first assignment was difficult but it was good in terms of the percentage <> was good so we could assess where we were at in terms of our knowledge and preparing us for the unit. <> was a fantastic tutor and I was very lucky to have <> as my tutor in both of my units, really an amazing tutor. <> is a great lecturer and funny as well. <> was great in explaining real life examples and filling in for <>.",5

1219,18,I really enjoyed this unit - found the content interesting and also the way the assignments were structured (although challenging) made me think outside the box. My tutor was also really helpful and informative.,5

157,53,The teachers are amazing.,5
1210,96,"the organisation, opportunities for growth",5

1222,303,"really great lectures by <>, very engaging and i would say he is the best lecturer i have had so far
the use of discussion board was good too (most units do not use it well and let it go to waste). would be good if more than 3 students used it though... maybe they could add a participation mark to encourage discussion board use
revision questions were lifesavers",5
159,43,"My tutor <> was amazing, funny, and always so helpful in my learning and understanding, lecturer <> was funny and made it easy to learn was great meeting <> at the interviews, <> seemed really nice and always tried to provide real life examples which was great!",5

Having Lectures recorded.",5
1225,96,The VARIETY,5
159,505,"I thought it was great that the <> tasks were reduced from last semester which was great. Really helped for <> like me. 

The addition of the extra help-desk sessions in week 13 helped so much! Really made a difference and it would be good if that could be done in the future semesters for future students. Will make a huge difference for their grades. I wanted to thank the tutors in the help-desk that I saw in the last week <>, <>, <> and <> who were so supportive and explained what I was doing correctly and what I needed to improve. They made a huge difference for myself and other students. This really helped me take my tasks home and work on it and understand it so I could problem solve and submit my tasks.

My tutor <> was amazing, <> really helped me progress my learning! I repeated this unit as I failed test 2 and <> was so nice and understanding and that is why I chose to repeat it this semester otherwise I would have postponed it and not sure if I would have repeated. <> was my tutor last semester who was amazing and really helped me with my understanding, and I was thinking of pulling out prior to census but <> was so kind and supportive in explaining that programming takes time and that I will develop those skills with practice throughout the semester which I did thanks to <>. Very thankful to both of my tutors for all of their support and helping me progress in programming. I also wanted to thank the tutors in the help desk <>, <>, <>, <>, <>, <>, <>, and <> for being so helpful as I saw them all last semester in the help desk and they all were amazing as well. I also saw my tutor <> many times as well for assistance who was amazing.

1222,245,seminar presentation,5

1230,10,Interesting content,5
1231,538,<> enthusiasm and support.,5
1232,451,I really enjoyed the triad portion of this subject. It is really useful to be able to actually practice counselling rather than just learning it theoretically.,5
163,232,The only good thing was being allowed multiple attempts at the online test.,5
163,291,"Best aspect - but also a negative - that the subject content was so easy, especially from a <> point of view. Oh and having <> as the convenor/lecturer - his notes are always so well thought out, and his lectures are engaging. Please clone <> or make him teach other lecturers how to teach!",5
1233,321,"Definitely <>. She was such a great conveyor of information and knowledge. To the point and I could see she put so much into it.

The 2 guest lecturer's were great.",5
1251,232,"I guess the tutes were the most helpful, in terms of actually making sense of and understanding the content.
I liked the amount of contact hours, and having 1hr lecture, 1hr tute, 2hr lab.

I became closer with a lot of my peers due to the mental anguish induced by the subject.",5

1259,54,"It is well structured and easy to apply concepts early on. The teaching is effective and at least for the first half, much of the content is geared towards new coders, additionally we have the option to take things at our own pace, which helps for those of us who are slower on the uptake.",5
1258,288,How organised the unit was. I loved and appreciated being able to download all the study materials at the start of semester and work through them at my own pace. It made it very easy to be prepared for each week.,5
