1,1,This unit is very helpful and informative on topics we haven't previously touched on,5
7,1,it was well organised and allowed you to think about what it would be like if you ran your own company,5
1153,1,<> is a great tutor and lecturer,5
127,1,"A wrap up of some important info regarding practice before graduating. Although the content could be more relevant to interior design, it is a good summary before graduating.",5
1313,1,"well organised, easy work to complete along side our other units. Helpful class to prepare us for the real design world",5
242,1,"I think knowing the important theory in documentation and running my own <> firm. 
I also think its very helpful as I now understand the process of documentation",5
1473,1,This unit taught me how to deal with professionalism...how to deal with clients and designers/contractors. I simply love the content of this unit......,5
1753,1,I found the lectures interesting.,5
1162,1,Overall content was good. Assignment structure was great.,5
1319,1,The information/content covered.,5
1848,1,The works are divided among the weeks so it doesnt take up much time.,5
4137,1,the tutor is friendly and willing to help students with the project.,5
1,1,This unit could probably run in <> semester when students have less work,5
4763,1,worked well and was understanding of all other units we had in our last semester too,5
4824,1,"Overall this unit is well organizsed, I did enjoy it!",5
1153,1,"I feel like I havent learnt anything, as the work was always copying what was in the lecture with our own additional changes. The tasks make sense but we dont go into detail about how to produce them",5
127,1,"*File organisation on blackboard. Same information repeated in multiple docs in confusing ways. Blackboard not used properly.
*Lectures need more clarity and explanation.
*The entire subject is geared towards architecture students and students 'going to work in an architectural office'... but we are all interior designers and I am going to work in an interior design studio. Needs more re-alignment to this.",5
4752,1,i am very satisfied with the unit and i don't think there should be anything to be improved,5
4666,1,Everything is good of this unit.,5
1313,1,clearer instructions on what exactly is due,5
242,1,"Nothing, I think its very well organised and structured",5
1437,1,"My only comment is that I would liked to have been able to do this unit early in the course, even semester 1.",5
1473,1,I m highly highly satisfied with this unit.....no complains or things to be improved. The content is impressive.....the tutor is fabulous...most easy and fun unit for my entire semester.,5
5308,1,"The learning methods. I've heard a lot of people saying that this was a 'dry' subject. Some of the learnings weren't practical, and didn't interest the students enough. Students should have their own brief to choose for the project management unit, so everyone would be doing different thing. Most people just copy-and-paste because the answers were all the same, anyway. If students could choose their own brief, I think it'd be more interesting to see/ do.",5
5319,1,nice   useful,5
1753,1,would have been good to finish the final assignment a week or so earlier to allow more time to focus on capstone.,5
5460,1,Im happy with the organization of the unit.,5
5191,1,"I think the unit is good, only thing is its hard to work with hypotheticals.. maybe move examples on blackboard like a database would be beneficial.",5
1162,1,The deliverables were somewhat unclear - what was asked for in writing didn't always align with verbal communication.,5
3364,1,I think this is a clearly presented unit,5
1319,1,Further discussion of weekly lectures in tutorial sessions to better understand content covered.,5
1331,1,Maybe a little more streamlined uploading of content but overall it was very good,5
5303,1,"Nothing, love the unit <>",5
6489,1,"Overall is good, no comment",5
4137,1,make the project brief is clearer. It is really confusing especially the weekly task that assigned.,5
2,2,"Nothing, waste of time... it is easier just to read the books",5
240,2,The instructors are usually very good though.,5
1387,2,<> was by far the best instructor teaching this unit. The content was effectively delivered and with genuine teaching ability.,5
3646,2,<> teaching,5
3658,2,I love the ground instructors and they can relate to the students and are willing to give them extra time to understand the topic,5
2,2,"Organistion is absolute trash. <> expects students to jump through hoops for them, but when it comes to providing a decent learning environment they couldnt be bothered.",5
240,2,"<> is an appalling joke. They treat us like a number, just trying to get us in and out as quick as possible. They treat us Swinburne students as second rate citizens compared to their <> contracts. They have no understanding of our other commitments to uni or work life and act as if they are the only thing that matter. They are very poorly organised.",5
1387,2,"The examination consistency was ridiculous. There was no real oversight and many freely skipped and pushed back exams without due course. Those who had <> were treated like they had committed a crime and the staff were overall, very inconsiderate to the circumstances of the unit. The reality is that <> days of <> are no where near enough to prepare a student for the <> exam. You add to this a stupid scaling system that disadvantages students who do the <> on time and you have a culture of students freely changing their exam dates out of fear of failure. A better system of planning teaching time to suite the complexities of the exams is required to help students actually learn and pass. The overall impression received is that<> does not care about it's students unless they happen to be <> and god forbid you ask a question about the marking scheme because no-one seems to know. Even the unit outline is unclear and misleading in the break up of marks.",5
3646,2,"We were not informed of changes to our class scheduling regarding full day classes until week 1, after our Uni timetables were already confirmed. It definitely is not practical to only provide 2 days of classes to learn the whole of <>, which is ranked second most difficult of the <> subjects up there with <>, of which we were given 7 weeks to learn. Similarly we were given 5-6 weeks for <> which is half as hard as <>. 2 weeks simply isn't enough if you want students to pass internals and <> exams. Internal exam dates were not posted on blackboard so if we missed a <> school due to being sick no one knew when internals would be sat. Staff really need to get their act together and provide a more organised unit which actually communicates with students.",5
3658,2,"I find that the lecture/ground school can be a bit unorganised and ground instructors aren't updated on what we have done prior and i find communication to be word of mouth and information can be misinterpreted.
I also believe that there isn't enough class time to cover all topics adequately.",5
3,3,"Our supervisor. <> was very responsive, supportive and provided the clarity we needed throughout our assessment.",5
133,3,It was nice how much freedom they gave us just to work on our projects and how they treated us as equals.,5
137,3,Great experience.  Project management is hard.  I learnt I don't want to do it.,5
135,3,The staff. They made what they could out of a bad situation. The freedom to develop what I wanted was also great.  The unit is brilliant when it's given the resources it needs.,5
42,3,"It actually let us do what we should do and provide necessary but not direct help which simulate the industry very well. No help, just guidance, that's good!",5
601,3,Being able to collaborate on interesting projects was very good. I did enjoy what we were doing and it definitely improved my programming abilities. I feel like I made some good memories with the team and generally I'm happy to have done this unit and experienced it (even if the experience was painful at times).,5
1100,3,It was better run than the first semester unit.,5
1104,3,"In the <> semester, we were provided with support from the start of the Semester and <> who took over the workload from <> deserves all the credit he could get. He was very friendly with everyone and was in communication with the students frequently.",5
1148,3,I learned a lot from my client and team members. My product will be useful for a resume.,5
134,3,"Doing the <> side of <> I got to collaborate with the <> students and work closely with <>, who was the supervisor and convenor for the <>. The freedom and autonomy provided by the unit was the best aspect.",5
131,3,"Real life work, real life rewards and consequences :D",5
1201,3,"I loved how this unit and the corresponding Semester 1 unit enabled students to spend a whole year putting all their skills to use in a real project. The project we had was challenging but achievable, and we were basically given free reign to organise by ourselves how it would be achieved over the year. I liked how there wasn't too many useless time-wasting aspects of the unit - for much of it there were no lectures (which are a bit of a waste of time for a subject like this).",5
1463,3,"Working on real-world projects and having more experienced supervisors overseeing smaller groups, rather than tutors taking large groups for tutorials.",5
1743,3,Work reminds me of industry projects,5
422,3,Freedom to create something of your own,5
2222,3,The opportunity to work effectively with a team for a decent length of time,5
3237,3,"No wasted time in unnessecary lectures, just get out there and make something.",5
3300,3,"Practical industry experience is invaluable, and this unit allows you to experience it without restrictions.
Probably the best unit I've taken.",5
1265,3,Got to work on a game with the games students,5
1354,3,"Our clients were amazing people, very happy I got to meet and work under them",5
1356,3,"Getting to work with the <> and <> <>! This is such an amazing opportunity and an invaluable chance to gain access to the <> industry through affiliation with <> and a number of professional <> developers. <> was also such an inspiring and dedicated guy to work with, he deserves a pay rise for setting all of this up :)",5
3660,3,The relatively free nature in which we can dictate how the project gets completed,5
1766,3,All.,5
385,3,I have learned more in this unit than any other unit I have taken. The lectures were delivered extremely well and Blackboard was used effectively.,5
3,3,"I understand that for this unit, most work and assessed items were particular to each group, but at times the requirements to pass felt a bit ambiguous. Our group was lucky to have a wonderful supervisor to guide us through this.",5
133,3,It would probably be better if the semester's lectures were pre-planned. I heard there were a couple interesting ones I missed because I was under the impression there wasn't a lecture on.,5
137,3,"For students working with the <> students, a more concrete way to provide feedback on them would be appreciated.",5
135,3,"To be better organised. To have to pull past employees in to salvage what is meant to be the course's most important unit is a joke. I don't blame <>, <> or <> for the disorganisation. <> was given far too many responsibilities due to Swinburne's mistreatment of the com-sci department and <> and <> had to jump on a sinking ship. They all did fantastically given the circumstances.",5
4820,3,"Submission requirements were not very clear. We were essentially told to just submit the same things as semester 1. However, it's always good to have a formal document outlining the deliverables so we can be certain",5
4826,3,"Consistency throughout the unit, clearer requirements.",5
42,3,"It actually let us do what we should do and provide necessary but not direct help which simulate the industry very well. No help, just guidance, that's good!",5
4959,3,"Everything, this unit was a complete and utter joke. We had our client abandon us midway through the year and ITS non-communicating with us for the whole year, resulting in a project CREATED FOR A CLIENT FROM SWINBURNE FOR SWINBURNE STUDENTS that lacks its main feature. There's is absolutely nothing that could have been worse with how this unit went except for the fact that <>, our supervisor, was the only thing keeping us going. Could someone from SWINBURNE PLEASE CONTACT ME REGARDING THIS.",5
601,3,"Too many to list. Need to have more effective student-supervisor communication support (sometimes it's hard to reach our supervisor or client because they're busy a lot of the time). Up front document or report listing everything to be handed in. We didn't even realise we needed to write certain documents until a decent way into our development. Group selection is not particularly good, I don't know whether it's just that a lot of people are inherently lazy, but it's nearly impossible to assign tasks to everyone and expect them to be done in a timely manner unless money is involved. Perhaps Blackboard could be utilised to allow teams to be picked based on motivation or grades. I hate ranting but I'm honestly sick of getting teams that can't be bothered to come together each week and our area of communication is just a virtual echo chamber.",5
1104,3,The initial subject <> was poorly organised given the greater than expected numbers from the 2nd year students. This means that initial contact with the client was delayed. The initial subject ran without support from a Supervisor which resulted in the <> addressing the students.,5
1106,3,Better communication of deadlines and submission dates.,5
5201,3,The assessment criteria needs to be more communicated. Blackboard could be used more in this space in addition to providing resources.,5
3269,3,Assessment requirements could be a little more clear; the student handbook could do with some updating to be more clear and consistent,5
1148,3,"The origanisation of this unit was terrible. I'm not sure what was going on behind the scenes, but supervisors were absent or unavailable, teams were given incorrect information on submission, and the requirements varied wildly between teams.",5
134,3,Organisation and scheduling of meetings were a bit messy.,5
131,3,i have no problem with the unit. It's just my team :P I gave 5 for the third criteria above because it should be N/A,5
1183,3,It was fine. Nothing really wrong with it. All projects were different but the assessments seemed flexible enough to be fine.,5
1201,3,"I would question whether assessing the video skills of <>  students is really the best way to measure their learning over the course of their degree, but apart from that this unit was really well done.",5
3461,3,A bit more example of previous work. A lot of this semester was guest lectures.,5
1463,3,"Improved organisation. It took four weeks to release the project we could work on, there was little to no clarification on what the requirement of the projects were and until we took it upon ourselves to contact the supervisor directly, we did not know what was require of us. <> was the supervisor/client for our project and had a good understanding of the requirements, however, he was on long service leave for the entirety of semester two, leaving us with no one who understood the project enough to provide us useful guidance. During the second semester we had <> as a supervisor who was also on long service leave for a few weeks in the middle, followed by some sick leave in the later weeks of the semester. This made it very difficult to produce a high quality <>, as we were mostly unsure of the requirements of the unit and whether we were on track",5
3711,3,This was much more improved compared to last semester. Since it was very more organised and I kept on track with the weekly content,5
1763,3,"Organisation, announcements and criteria. There was little to no guidance especially since with the constant teacher swapping. No help was provided or guidance and teachers barely knew what needed to be handed in or at what time.",5
422,3,"Less documentation.
More supervisor control when groups get off track.",5
5475,3,if the unit was more organised and structured.,5
4904,3,More involved supervisors,5
2222,3,Communication between the convenor and the students could have been more effective at times,5
3236,3,Inability to change teammates who do not pull their weight.,5
3237,3,"I've never been 100% sure on what the academic supervisors wanted in terms of deliverables and to what level they wanted it. 
I know some groups had to do some really serious documentation where as my group, in comparison, had to do very little.",5
6191,3,"keeping a consistent convener for the unit. and when a change over from one convener to the next occurs, the new convener is sufficiently brought up to speed with how each project should be handled in terms of deliverable's.",5
3251,3,This semesters requirements were clear.,5
3300,3,Clearer definition of when assessment tasks are due and what is required from them.,5
1265,3,The lack of communication lead to confusion on due dates due to the swapping of supervisors and lecturers.,5
1354,3,"<> our supervisor literally was on Holiday for most of this semester. This come across as extremely unprofessional by Swinburne not to be able to give us a supervisor that will be here the entire semester which impacts our teams progress.

The university should be embarrassed by this.",5
1356,3,"Providing clearer requirements for what the deliverables are for the unit. There is a student handbook for example that has a checklist, this ""Final Deliverables Check List"" is not consistent with what was requested from our supervisor. Updating that or providing tailored versions for teams working on different projects, such as games, would be helpful.",5
5293,3,too many students that are not in their <> year allowed to do this unit. Unfair expectation on students that haven't failed half their course to do all the work to make up for lack of knowledge from other members.,5
6346,3,would be good if better instruction to organise team in first semester,5
3660,3,Better options to deal with students who dont contribute in anyway to the group,5
385,3,Nothing to be improved. This unit was very enjoyable and educational.,5
6525,3,An example of a poorly executed video so that we have a reference point.,5
4,4,Having Echo is very helpful for the times that I am unable to attend lectures.,5
265,4,"The assignments were good, they were relevant to what we were doing. It was also good being able to complete the assignment week by week.",5
1610,4,"the relaxed nature of the assessment, was a welcome relief from other units",5
1648,4,"<> was a really great lecturer and explained things really well, and i enjoyed having her as a lecturer for 2 weeks. I also found <> to be good and really wanted me to learn which helped me greatly. Although he can speak quite fast which can get tricky I found he was good to learn from.",5
1837,4,the unit is already well organised,5
1631,4,How helpful the teachers were in helping me understand certain problems.,5
3740,4,Lots of real life examples,5
265,4,"i  think overall it was a good uni, things were well organised and laid out. maybe having the tutorials more interactive would have been good.",5
1610,4,Having more involving content in earlier weeks. The first five week felt like a recap of the <> unit and some of the content covered really didnt have a place in a <> year <> course.,5
1648,4,"This unit was so poorly organised and structured and I was really disappointed. Firstly we had 3 different lecturers that interchanged throughout the unit and each had different teaching methods which was confusing to keep up with. Secondly, we did not have a revision class as promised in the unit outline so were unable to revise effectively. Thirdly, for our final assessment the feedback was not delivered via a marked assignment but instead the solutions uploaded into two separate files to blackboard so you had to manually go through & check what answers you got right & wrong. This is so hard to do as some of the solutions provided could be interpreted as correct/incorrect depending on your knowledge of the topic. After receiving the feedback for the final assessment i had to email back & forth with 3 different lecturers to clarify what parts I had gotten right/wrong to prepare for the exam. 

Finally, I found <> teaching method to be really confusing and all over the place. She would leave parts of the tutorial or work things out different to assignments and subsequently I was marked down in assessments because of this.",5
4947,4,"The content was way too simple for a <> year unit. A lot of repetition from <>, <> and <> units. The presentation assignment lacked instruction. The tutorials were often a waste of time and i could have completed the work at home by myself.",5
1631,4,"The exact schedule of the unit. I understand this could be due to staffing arrangements, though. These last few weeks have seemed to be a bit messy - especially in terms of exam revision. <> was asking us to come in the week after week 12 for exam revision (the week of our exam) which I found quite unfair.",5
3740,4,A some of the topics covered in this subject were previously covered in <> so would have been good to have all new content,5
5,5,Well structured,5
1194,5,The Textbook.,5
1301,5,<> and <>. These guys are great and I have no complaints. Two of the best in <>.,5
1391,5,"I enjoyed the actual content we covered, the theories we learnt I feel have a practical use and I would mostly follow a career in this field.",5
1642,5,tests,5
3302,5,It was actually an interesting subject and the content was very relatable to the real world and its application which was cool. i really enjoyed the content.,5
3404,5,"<> assignments, tutorials, lectures.

The intention of the <> assignment was very good. I understand that the assignment may have been left late to explain.  However, the program itself was a good choice. <> is good with analysing raw data and it was easy to interpret what is happening with the <> between the <>. I enjoyed this part of the unit and despite some of the complaints I hope that this assignment idea is kept for next year.",5
3417,5,<> is just a great bloke!,5
1348,5,tutorials communicate ideas well,5
224,5,Some of the normal <> chapters were very interesting and I was happy with the teaching staff.,5
3447,5,The lectures were well structured and topics were explained clearly.,5
1394,5,"• 3 tests + exam were all from questions that we did either during the tutorials or were given the answers to on blackboard, that was awesome and helped me a lot with -hopefully- passing this unit.",5
1885,5,"more clear understanding of the things that we learn in <>, dealing the <> and <> , understanding the importance of <>, selection method of <>",5
5,5,<> labs,5
4740,5,The labs should be spaced out further away from week 12,5
4916,5,Clarify the assignment questions neatly.,5
3240,5,"The textbook was clearly written by idiots and must be replaced with something more suitable. The book is poorly set out, often includes questions that have no explanation in the relevant chapter, and frequently references previous information without stating where that information can be found.

The labs were a complete waste of time and did not benefit my understanding of the subject at all. They were confusing and the work required for the reports was not relevant to the rest of the subject",5
3307,5,It would be useful that if when we were in tutorials the teacher was actually giving us the correct information. We are not allowed formula sheets but are expected to remember all of the formulas. This could be more than 20. How are we supposed to remember all of the formula's required for a 3 hour exam.,5
1194,5,"Getting marks back to students has been terrible in this unit. It is now week 13 and none of the lab marks have been returned. The test marks have taken far too long as well. How are students supposed to know how they are going if they only start getting assessments back in week 11? 
Onto the assignment, while it showed students how to <> works, <> is not <> software, it ran poorly, and most of all, is not used in industry. 
If students were to enter a business and try to do <> calculations they would be laughed at. Swinburne needs to invest in industry standard programs in order to keep up with current employers.",5
1301,5,"Having this unit and <> clash in their lecture times, with so many students doing both is not fair on students. It shows poor organisation on the Uni's behalf. The fact that this clashing lecture wasn't recorded on the echo centre was the icing on the cake. Absolutely unacceptable. Pure garbage. No excuses. Don't do this rubbish again...

In terms of the lectures, <> is great. no complaints. As is <> who took some lectures and was my tutor. He is a great tutor. 

The pracs weren't very good. It was unclear what was expected and they seemed to be rushed and a little too difficult. Look at how the <> pracs are run, these are properly run and executed pracs. They are also run too late in the semester. Students are too loaded up between weeks 9-12. The pracs could be run earlier, and spread out more.",5
1391,5,"The assignment was poorly explained and set up leaving students to have to interpret most of the information without any examples or guidance, we had one lecture explaining how to use the software two days before it was due. The software only ran on one computer at uni so if you have 150 students last minute trying to get results its impossible to get a spot on the computer. 

The labs for this unit were very rushed and there was no explanation at all, you simply went to the lab recorded values and left, we may as well just had values emailed to us. The size of the groups were huge, its hard to get a look at the experiments or participate in them, I don't understand why we had three labs crammed into just two sessions, we had a whole semester we could have done them over. 

<> although was taught in the one hour lecture each week we didn't spend much time on it in any of the tutes, the assignment was related to it but I think it could have been better integrated.",5
1433,5,"I think the lecture structure should be changed. The <> material is really hard to understand in large slabs and I would have preferred to have these classes consecutively, rather than once a week for the duration of the course. 

The labs did very little for learning also. I would like to give feedback for my lab instructor, but he did not even introduce himself. The labs were very much turn up and get figures, then figure it out yourself. The <> lab and the work involved in it were not proportional to the 4% it was worth. 

The assignment was difficult, simply because one week before the deadline we finally found out how to use the program and what we had to do. To find out so late threw many students under the bus.

Also, the tutorials should be run with the content closer to that taught in tutorials. Myself and many others felt that two or three weeks between learning the content in lectures and the questions in tutorials made the content harder to learn and put a higher workload on us later in the semester, where it could have been prevented by using the two weeks at the start of semester without tutorials.",5
4799,5,less marks allocated to exam,5
1642,5,replace assignment,5
5461,5,Provide a clearer explanation for the assignment.,5
5580,5,Small Quizzes on each week for revision on each week.,5
5681,5,Update the version of the excel so can access by university computer,5
968,5,final exam weightage should be reduced,5
5219,5,cfd tutorials,5
3302,5,<> needs to not be late to most lectures haha. the assignment needs to be updated but <> already knows that. <> is a smart guy though. He's a good teacher,5
3367,5,"Change the assignment to use Ansys or similar software, rather than the Excel. I believe this is being worked on for future classes. It would have been good to have a few CFD demonstrations in the lectures or if <> was able to show some his previous professional work so we could see what CFD is like in the real world. We went to his office to watch a small example but I found his CFD consulting stories very interesting and would have liked to see more examples from some of these.",5
5245,5,Labs should be spaced out through the semester and conducted earlier if possible.,5
3404,5,"Practicals. The lab instructor <> does his job well. He continues to explain the concepts behind each practical until the student has a fair idea of what is involved. 

However, as each submission can be done as a group of 3,  I believe some students might take advantage of this. It is also difficult to mark so many reports individually. 
My recommendation is to get the lab instructor to check some of the calculations involved (similar to the idea behind the practicals in <> with the equivalent mass experiment). Otherwise the labs are very good and they help the students engage with <> more.",5
3417,5,It would be preferable to have the labs earlier instead of towards the end of the unit as exam time is approaching and the bulk of the work is due all at once.,5
1348,5,"Lecturer speaks well in person however it is very difficult to understand the recorded lectures. often he moves away or turns away from the microphone and would be appreciated if he repeated the questions student ask so we can hear thim online

labs were  obsure and fluids assignment had limited help",5
3439,5,"As has been the trend with <> subjects throughout my degree the labs for the subject felt irrelevant and do not enhance our understanding of the content. Furthermore the assignment felt the same as it did not feel that it related to the content. Explanations on each completed question and how the parameters change the behaviour of the flow would have provided a better learning experience.

After concerns were raised regarding the assignment an explanation session was finally given in week 11. This session was extremely late in the semester and forced a lot of students to reattempt the assignment after finding out what they had attempted was wrong. Furthermore the assignment could only be  completed on the computer in <> which was only available <> to <> during the week. This was ridiculous as many students are further in their degree meaning they are juggling a number of commitments in those hours already.

The content taught on <> felt like a waste of time as the content was heavily theory based and would like be applicable to many students.",5
224,5,"<> was one of the most interesting subjects I did, and felt like I learnt a lot in the subject and it was structured really well. However I think <> was almost the opposite. The way the subject was sort of split in 2 with <> and <> was useless, The way <> got taught was also useless and I still don't even really know why it is a part of the content for this subject. The organisation of the subject wasn't the greatest, however the final lecture was very good and summarized the subject really well, which extremely aided my exam preparation. I was sort of happy with the way the content got taught for the <> chapters. 
I don't believe the teaching staff decides the timetable, but whoever decided to put such a hard subject's main lecture on at <> <> <> is just crazy!!",5
3447,5,The assignment information is confusing. It would be good to have a class in a computer lab on using the software for the assignment. The <> lab could be improved.,5
1394,5,"• we were given an assignment that could only be done using a handful of computers at uni! with over 100 students doing this unit, that was by far the most ridiculous aspect of my semester!",5

3880,6,The table provided in the tutorials so that we could have a clear way to organise the theories.,5
3899,6,"All of it was so interesting, the best was probably learning about the <> theories and discussing them as a class",5
2436,6,learning new skills and theories.,5
4180,6,the tutorials. they re explained and summarised parts of the lectures more clearly.,5
756,6,The lectures were very interesting. I particularly enjoyed the videos attached.,5

4264,6,"The laid back class discussions, the resources available on BB",5
2714,6,The summary guide for all major theories was very helpful,5
1067,6,"I enjoyed the group tasks in the tutorials, such as reading a newspaper article and identifying the <> concepts. I liked the graphs used in tutorials as well, like the <> infographic used to show <> theory. I loved the lectures on <> - the lecturer presented in a very interesting and engaging way, using lots of current examples and showed a lot of passion for the subject matter. I also liked the lectures on <> research (week <> I think) and the week <> lecture on <> - this lecturer is well informed and presents information concisely - my attention never drifted and the examples used made it easy to understand.",5
4615,6,The <> aspect to the unit.,5
699,6,"I think instead of two assignments per semester we should only have one major one, and have weekly revision quizzes each week so the emphasis is on the content and we are not stressing about fitting in two assignments to our uni life.",5

6035,6,Actively posting on the blackboard for upcoming assessment would be of a great help.,5
6124,6,nothing. I think that the unit is very well organised and all learning materials are provided for us on blackboard.,5
1016,6,"-During the lectures, there always seemed to be a technology related issue with the projector and speakers.",5
6352,6,Nothing really needs improving there were a few issues with blackboard but that can't be helped.,5
3723,6,I think it would be helpful to put more information about assignments on blackboard such as examples are clearer instructions on what is required of the assignments. I found I had to email my tutor quite a lot regarding the first assignment.,5
3880,6,This unit could be improved by including more information about how assignments should be written in this unit.,5
3899,6,more reflection of past weeks in tutorials (linking what we're learning to the other theories),5

4196,6,"Better explanations, slides for lectures had some inconsistency with the lecturer",5

4264,6,"Essay writing tutorial at least 2 weeks before essays due, instead of a week after the due date.
For the essay sheet, more forward in what was required; for example myself and other students didn't think intoduction and conclusion was necessary on the first assignment as it specified what to do for it yet didn't say anything about intro and conc.",5
4215,6,the length of the lectures to be shortened and the tutorials longer,5
2714,6,Unit guide did not specify Assignment 1 details or due date.,5
6836,6,"more information provided on lecture slides, not just dot points
explain the topics more clearly, not go on a random explantation of something",5
1067,6,"There seemed to be a disconnect between the tutor, lecturers and course convenor with regards to all being on the same page with the course (I believe this was because it was recently changed and there is a new course convenor). My tutor was not fully aware of the <> participation requirements. The tutorials where a bit bland as well, better use of engaging activities would be excellent (such as videos, role play scenarios, talking more about real life examples). The lecturer on <> theories was really lacklustre - the concepts where interesting but the presentation of them was so boring, this may just be the lecturers style but I struggled to keep my attention focused. These lectures were long and relied to heavily on videos.",5
4615,6,"This could simply be my lack of understanding of <> concepts in general, however I found myself continuously going to the textbook simply to clarify what was taught in the lecture. Problem isn't going to the textbook understand but it made going to the lectures somewhat meaningless. Found it difficult to apply the overlapping <> theories/sub-theories to <>.",5
6186,6,lectures were not as similar as the tutes,5
8,7,having a video record for this unit is necessary,5
123,7,"Tute labs; everything is taught and practiced in the same class.
Support for class topics and assignments are well done.",5
486,7,The class discussion,5
1174,7,<> was a very positive tutor who was engaging although the classes were so long,5
1237,7,The assignment,5
1284,7,"I liked the way the mid-sem test and the assignment are set out, I also like the fact that marks are allocated to participation, as it encourages class discussion and allows students to understand the content more in depth as a result to this class discussion.",5
1357,7,everything,5
1377,7,2+2 is 4 minus 1 das 3 quick mafs,5
1479,7,this unit can be with early semester so student will understand the concept,5
1539,7,"The staff members put in a good effort to help the students as much as possible, which is admirable.",5
292,7,"Although the 3 hour sessions were very lengthy, I did enjoy the fact that the 'lecturer' and 'tutor' were the same person.",5
1540,7,Blackboard interactions,5
1826,7,the teaching,5
440,7,the teacher was nice and explained the concepts in detail.,5
1889,7,The class participation. Motivated me to score more and more in future weeks of learning and actually reading lecture material before class.,5
1909,7,tutorial questions and the way she explained the subject.,5
1929,7,Tutor,5
965,7,Useful materials are given.,5
3393,7,Assignment was not that good but the rest is good.,5
3526,7,"The best aspect was having <> as a tutor, he made sure everyone understood what was being taught and he was the type of tutors who made everything clear before class finished.",5
1825,7,"How important the critical thinking was in an organisation, and thinking out  of box was very important aspect, and the subjective issue behind each and very scenario's.",5
1911,7,the unit was interesting,5
2023,7,<> is a great teacher and tries to keep us awake by using examples from outside of <> theory to grasp the key juice of the subject. But he needs to slow down for <> students to keep up.,5
4032,7,3-hour is way too long,5
8,7,"right now there are too many information.
it is hard to categorize the subjects.
it is hard to answer the question. need to do more practice for how to write the answers and what exactly you need to write for the each part of questions.",5
4807,7,more examples of the pass exams and examples related to the topic,5
4855,7,Assignment marking was way too strict in my opinion.,5
486,7,"The structure of the unit, whilst class based participation have been useful, there should be lecture component and tutorial component for convener guidance for students to understand in a logical manner in preparation for exams. Many students would feel that their activeness in class being overshadowed by outstanding/high performing students taking the spotlight out of self interest. Although it is presumed that the class leader regulates and gives everybody an equal chance at participation, participation points are biased towards the higher achieving/competitive students.",5
4735,7,Loved the unit.,5
5207,7,All good,5
1174,7,The 3 hour class is too long and hard to concentrate in the second half on very dry content. It is difficult to do the questions without and introduction to the content in a lecture and therefore the class doesn't get much practice on questions.,5
1237,7,Should change the tutorial questions. Coz in exam they won’t help coz we do answer articles in exam.,5
1284,7,"I really enjoyed this unit and find it hard to fault. However, a small improvement which can be made is i think the three hour class is quite lengthy at times and some class activities in between learning the content i think would make the class a little more enjoyable.",5
1357,7,"Nothing, it was good",5
1377,7,the exam- might as well write a thesis on the exam so we spend the entire reading time trying to understand what needs to be done - had to read question like three times before doing it and wasteded time - previous exams are so much better - sometimes teacher jokes arent funny dont b showin up ur education in here homie,5
1479,7,More up to date,5
1530,7,if the exam is 50,5
1539,7,The unit content is quite dull - but I understand that perhaps this cannot be helped.,5
292,7,"More of an indicator as to the sections of the large text that may not be so relevant. Some structure as to answering long questions would be appreciated, and the release of more exam papers, OR exam styled questions to gain a better idea of how to prepare for the exam. The tutorial questions were very different to the exam questions seen in the last tutorial. 

I also thought the assignment was quite ambiguous compared to previous semesters/years.",5
4677,7,The duration for the lab can be shorten,5
1826,7,More tutorial options,5
440,7,there should be more focus of assessment tasks and have less learning material for exams.,5
1889,7,"Tagging the text book for use in Final Exam.
Even though students read the entire text book, it is unlikely they remember every page number of relevant topics. <>is a major unit with so much to learn. Tagging the book will at least help them save time and attempt all questions in Final Exam. For the students who actually open the text book on the final exam itself, they will at least learn a thing or two at the end of the exam as I believe what you put in to your mind last moment will remain long.",5
1909,7,more quiz during the tutorial.,5
1929,7,"More real past exam, not just some draw from textbooks",5
5554,7,"I would have benefited more if there were traditional classes, meaning lectures and tutorials instead of the single <>-hour class. The assessment for class participation could also be replaced with something else, like weekly online quizzes or something.",5
5569,7,Do lecture and tutorial separately,5
2952,7,The assessment's  mark should upgrade to 50%,5
965,7,Separate the lecture  and tutorial.,5
6054,7,Three hours of class is quite long. Maybe can shorten to two hours because can't really concentrate more than two hours.,5
6239,7,More teachers like <>,5
3393,7,"Should change assessment, which is the way assignment mark.",5
6264,7,I enjoyed everything,5
6263,7,"No exam, 2 hour lecture, 1 hour tutorial, exam should be weighted <> percent not <> percent, assignments should be marked easier, mid sem online should have easier questions and be weighted more. This subject shouldn't be in <> degrees.",5
3526,7,I didn't think <> teaching needed any improvement as he was doing excellently.,5
6303,7,im satisfied with this unit,5
5345,7,"1. night time class for full time working student 
2. more sample solution  in detail to help understand",5
6308,7,all good,5
4785,7,Assignment better set out,5
5328,7,"The assignment criteria could be more clear. The exam covers everything, really ? How many jobs required you this knowledge ?",5
6341,7,"Need change the class structure, student always cannot concentrate on 3 hours tutoria. If there is a lecture and lecture recording will be more helpful for student to review the theories",5
6343,7,ok,5
6388,7,"A three hour class is too much to handle in one hit. it should have been a one hour lecture and two hour tute like other units. As it is all theory, a lecture style delivery would have been more effective.",5
1825,7,"The subject was very intense, and had to learn and understand of theories in general. I found difficult to understand at start but gradually improved and able to understand later.",5
6414,7,have a lecture for 1 or two hours and tutorial insead of a 3 hour class,5
1911,7,more final exam past papers need to be conducted.,5
2023,7,Allowing lecture recordings and tutorials as I found it hard to concentrate for the full 3 hours,5
6448,7,"should explain using the textbooks in tutorials since we will have open book exams using the textbook therefore, we can be more familiar with it pages.",5
3851,7,Having the lecture component of the class recorded in case a student misses a class,5
4032,7,boring,5
6774,7,"I believe three hours for one class is too long especially for a heavy unit like <>. I prefer if we had a separate lecture class and a tutorial class. This way in tutorial class, the lecturer can focus on teaching the students how to apply the <> theories to articles (the format for final exam). I find the three hour combination of tutorial and lecture less effective as they are times where the lecturer could barely discussed the tutorial questions.",5
6775,7,"The session is too long, why not split it? Having lecture being conducted with tutorial together is fine if i can keep my eyes open for three hours straight. i mean a more effective way would be to split the class in two. That way absorption would be more effective.",5
